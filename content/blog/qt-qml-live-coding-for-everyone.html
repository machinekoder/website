<p>I figured that Python is not enough as I recently worked on a few more Qt/C++ projects. Since C++ is not easily live-codable, meaning we can't reload the entire project, another approach was necessary.</p>
<p>Therefore, I created a <a href="https://github.com/machinekoder/cpp-qt-live-coding">C++ version</a> of my live coding project. The most important update is, that live coding is now deployed as a QML module to be integrated into your own application.</p>
<p>This way, you can have all the benefits of live coding combined with the comfort of your own project setup.</p>
<p>Check out my video tutorial on how to get started with <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt/QML</a> live coding for C++:</p>

<p>If you are a Python user, you might want to take a look at the Python version of the project. I have also updated the QML live coding for Python to support embedding your project.</p>
