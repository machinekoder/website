<p>The hackerspace team recorded all talks and Frederic agreed to do the editing work. The first session of the meeting <strong>Machinekit Introduction</strong> by Michael and Bas, is now ready to be watched on YouTube:</p>

<p>Michael talks about Machinekit and potential applications in general. Bas gives a short introduction to his work on ROS in combination with Machinekit.</p>
<p>The location of the hackerspace is an old industrial plant building. The building is full of interesting old machines that need new electronics and controls.</p>
<p>So to speak, the Electrolab hackerspace has a lot of potential Machinekit applications waiting to be hacked on.</p>
<p>Therefore, the talks of the meeting primarily target Machinekit newcomers and beginners.</p>
<p>Please stay tuned for the second session <strong>Machinekit Workshop</strong>, a complete introduction to creating Machinekit configuration from HAL to UIs.</p>
