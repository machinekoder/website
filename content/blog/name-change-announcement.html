Due to marriage and a name merge, my family name is changing from Rössler to Poss. So, if you receive any messages, emails, and so on from "Alexander Poss," it might be me. To make the transition easier, I will keep "Rössler" as a middle name on professional media for some time, but eventually, I'm going to remove it altogether. The big upside of this name change is that anyone outside German-speaking countries should now have an easier time spelling and typing my name.</p>
<p>Summarizing: Alexander Rössler ⇾ Alexander Poss</p>
