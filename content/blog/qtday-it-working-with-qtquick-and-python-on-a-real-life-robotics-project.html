<span class="rt-reading-time" style="display: block;"><span class="rt-label rt-prefix"></span> <span class="rt-time">2</span> <span class="rt-label rt-postfix">minutes read<br/></span></span><p>Today I'm going to share with you the recording of my talk from <a href="https://www.qtday.it/">QtDay 2019</a>. It was my first time at QtDay, and I really can recommend it for everyone interested in a developer-focused conference all about Qt, QtQuick, and QML.</p>
<h2>Teaser</h2>
<p>I have learned many things about creating QtQuick applications with Python working on a graphical programming environment for a new industrial robot. In this talk, I'm going to elaborate on my experience, including practical topics such as development workflow and testing, using real-life examples.</p>
<p>In my talk, I will describe my experience working on a real-life project with QtQuick and Python. The project I'm talking about is a graphical programming environment for a new industrial robot, which will be released end of this year. My customer chooses Python over C++ for a couple of reasons which I will explain in my talk.</p>
<p>I have experience working with Qt for over a decade. Until last year, I have mostly worked with Qt C++, although I'm a passionate Python programmer for many years. Since I had many objections choosing Python over C++ when working Qt, I will express them in my talk and explain my findings in working on a real-life Python Qt project for over a year.</p>
<p>Besides talking about my findings working with Python and Qt, I will also elaborate on practical and relevant topics for the Python Qt programmer with real-life examples. These topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools, workflow, and lifecycle of a Python Qt project.</li>
<li>A way to structure a mixed Python and Qt QML project.</li>
<li>How to do unit and GUI testing for Qt application with pytest.</li>
<li>Clean coding practices for Python Qt applications.</li>
<li>Debugging mixed Python and C++ applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the year I intensively worked with Python and Qt, especially QtQuick, I not only encountered flowers and roses, but I also found many snares. Therefore, a part of my presentation is dedicated to informing you about them.</p>
<p>Watching this video is highly recommended if you are Qt C++ developer considering to test-drive Qt Python, if you are Python developer interested in Qt or if you are just curious about the robot HMI project I use as a basis for the talk.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the talk, you learned how to use QtQuick and Python in a real-life project. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time to cover everything in the speech.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments section or send me a message.</p>
